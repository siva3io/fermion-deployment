## Introduction

This is a public deployment helper project focused on deploying frontend & backend to the cloud. It is focused on coverage additions to existing services to be addressed by upcoming releases. It represents a preview of the information we provide in our existing release history documentation. Knowing about our upcoming coverage additions and priorities helps our customers plan, and we want to provide a way for our customers to help us ensure we are working on the most important requests.

## FAQs

**Q: Why did you build this?**

A: We know that our customers are making decisions and plans based on what we are developing, and we want to provide our customers the insights they need to plan. If our customers know that a coverage item is being worked on and will be released soon, we can help them avoid additional work if they are considering workarounds or custom resources to address their needs. Further, we want you to help us ensure we are working on the most important and impactful issues.


**Q: How can I provide feedback or ask for more information?**

A: When in doubt, please create an issue! Although we’ll focus on coverage issues, all submitted issues will get reviewed and/or forwarded appropriately. 

**Q: How can I request a feature be added to the script?**

A: We encourage you to open an issue, even if you’ve requested it before via other channels. All community-submitted issues will be reviewed by the roadmap maintainers. We’ve created a template to make it easy to open new issues.

**Q: Can I "+1" existing issues?**

A:We strongly encourage you to do so, as it helps us understand which issues will have the widest impact. You can navigate to the issue details page and add a reaction (thumbs up). There are six types of reactions supported (thumbs down “-1”, confused, heart, watching, laugh, hooray, and thumbs up +1). We can typically do 8-10 items per month with all necessary regression testing, and we want you to help us decide which items will benefit you the most.
